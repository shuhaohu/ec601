In this Twitter API practice, I wrote a python program that can gather information from Twitter. It now can view the latest 110 posts that the blogger posted on Twitter. 
It will first report how many tweets it has downloaded so far, then it will show the user how many pictures are being downloaded. It also will indicate the post ID of each post. 
Last it will show what date and time was the post originally posted by the Twitter account owner.
