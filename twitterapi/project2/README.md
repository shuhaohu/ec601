## Just need to run the twitterceshi.py and it will automatically call the google API.


Notes:
During the google sentiment analysis test, I found out that the feedback may not be accurate,
because when I entered the word "goodbye" the sentiment score is -0.5, so there is some error
exist, and also some keywords in the twitter post may not be relative to the topic. So the 
reslut is not hundred percent reliable. Some improvement could be applied to the project, 
such as filter more keywords for twitters post.
